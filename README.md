# Arch Linux Install Notes

[These are my notes](https://github.com/omgMerrickD/arch-install-notes/blob/master/arch-install-notes.md) for installing a base Arch Linux system on a Lenovo X1 Carbon 6th generation laptop.

This is still a work in progress.

*Use at your own risk!*

**TODO**: Learn how to properly install a WM (awesome, i3wm, etc.) and/or a DE (KDE Plasma).
